This is a get-together for everyone interested in the new Internet outside of corporate control that is now being built using decentralised technology.

In our meetings we update each other about everything interesting that has been happening recently in the field, discuss current developments and offer a platform to showcase your cool p2p project or idea.

We are not interested in blockchain projects that hijack a buzzword to fulfill neoliberal fantasies. We are especially interested in p2p tech as a path for people to do cool stuff together without centralised control.

Please join our next event and RSVP at [p2p-berlin.org](https://p2p-berlin.org/) ðŸ’™
