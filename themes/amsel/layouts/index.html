      It reminded me of the feeling when you sit around a campfire, suddenly all
      interactions slow right down as people are occupied with the flickering
      flames and changing colors. Both these activities posses a sense of
      sharing, safety and community. It's hard to say why this is, it is calming
      and disarming. Maybe it has something to do with having a simple task or
      function to perform, which acts both as a shared foundation and personal
      safety net.

      The future should be Agar Agar 3000. More campfires and boiling pots to
      sit around, more undefined spaces, shared activities from which we can
      take great risks. Definite experimentation with indefinite results.
      Activity and reflection.
